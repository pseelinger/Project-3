This project displays national statistics on consumption of fruits and vegetables by adults in the United States to make the point that most people are eating
well under the recommended amount per day. Click on the table at the bottom to see how much of each nutrient you would get from the food 
you picked. When, you click another, it will add to the total displayed by the gauges underneath the table. Try to put in a full day's worth of
food to see if what you normally eat is providing you with enough nutrients.
